## Completed Tasks

### Project Setup and Structure
- ✅ Set up React project with necessary dependencies
- ✅ Create project folder structure
- ✅ Implement basic routing structure
- ✅ Create global components (Header, Footer)
- ✅ Set up styling framework and responsive grid

### Animation Components
- ✅ Created vehicle-themed animations:
  - Bus Entry Animation for hero sections
  - Route Map Animation with moving bus
  - Service Cards with mini bus animations
  - Stats Counter with wheel design
- ✅ Implemented CSS animations for all components
- ✅ Created React components with proper props and documentation

### Page Components
- ✅ Implemented Home page with animated hero section and stats counters
- ✅ Developed About Us page with route map animation
- ✅ Created Services page structure with service cards

## Next Steps

### Frontend Development
1. **Complete Remaining Pages**
   - Build Gallery page with image grid
   - Implement Testimonials page with carousel
   - Create Contact page with form

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Add code splitting for route-based components
   - Optimize animations for low-power devices
   - Add responsive image handling

3. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test all animations across different browsers
   - Ensure responsive design works on all screen sizes
   - Implement accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
   - Add unit tests for components

### Backend Development
1. **Set up SpringBoot Backend**
   - Create project structure
   - Configure database connection
   - Set up security and authentication

2. **Implement API Endpoints**
   - Contact form submission
   - Service booking endpoints
   - Testimonial submission
   - Admin dashboard APIs

3. **Integration**
   - Connect frontend to backend APIs
   - Implement error handling
   - Add loading states for API calls

## Technical Debt and Considerations

1. **Animation Performance**
   - Consider adding a `reducedMotion` prop to disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion
   - Optimize CSS animations to use GPU acceleration where possible

2. **Asset Management**
   - Create an organized structure for images and other assets
   - Implement proper image optimization pipeline

3. **State Management**
   - Consider adding Redux or Context API for global state management as the application grows

## Timeline

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Complete remaining frontend pages
   - Begin performance optimization

2. **Medium-term (2-4 weeks)**
   - Set up SpringBoot backend
   - Implement core API endpoints
   - Connect frontend to backend

3. **Long-term (1-2 months)**
   - Complete all features
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Deployment preparation
